## Root Injector

When and How It's Created
    - The root injector is created during the application bootstrap process. When Angular starts your application, the bootstrapApplication() method creates a child injector of the platform injector, which becomes the root EnvironmentInjector. This happens automatically when the runtime initializes the Angular platform and bootstraps the application.

    - The creation process follows this hierarchy:

        Platform injector (top level)

        Root injector (your application's main injector)

        Component/module injectors (child injectors)

        Key Responsibilities
        The root injector handles several critical functions:

        Global singleton scope: Creates instances of services with singleton scope by default, ensuring only one instance of each service exists throughout the application

        Provider registration: Acts as a registrar for services, keeping track of how services should be created and provided to different parts of the application

        Dependency resolution: When components or services require dependencies, the root injector resolves them by identifying required services and providing their instances

        Platform initialization: Manages the application lifecycle and creates the initial set of components and services required to start the application

        Practical Example
        When you mark a service with @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }), you're telling Angular to register that service with the root injector, making it available globally as a singleton throughout your application. The dependency injection system relies internally on a runtime context where the current injector is available, allowing the injection mechanism to work properly.
