### Performance Optimization


1. Change Dtection
    Use OnPush strategy for all components where possible

    ✅ Implement immutable data patterns

    ✅ Use async pipe instead of manual subscriptions

    ✅ Detach components during animations or high-frequency updates

2.Bundle Size (High Impact)
    ✅ Implement lazy loading for feature modules

    ✅ Use tree-shaking friendly imports

    ✅ Analyze and optimize bundle size regularly

    ✅ Implement strategic preloading

3.DOM Optimization (Medium Impact)
    ✅ Use trackBy functions in *ngFor

    ✅ Implement virtual scrolling for large lists

    ✅ Use pure pipes for expensive transformations

    ✅ Minimize direct DOM manipulations

4.Memory Management (Medium Impact)
    ✅ Properly unsubscribe from observables

    ✅ Use takeUntil pattern for subscription management

    ✅ Avoid memory leaks in event listeners

    ✅ Clean up timers and intervals

5.HTTP & Data (Low-Medium Impact)
    ✅ Implement HTTP caching strategies

    ✅ Use pagination for large datasets

    ✅ Optimize API calls with debouncing

    ✅ Implement proper error handling

Memory Leak Prevention Checklist ✅
High Priority (Critical)
    ✅ Unsubscribe from all observables using takeUntil pattern

    ✅ Remove DOM event listeners in ngOnDestroy

    ✅ Clear timers and intervals when components are destroyed

    ✅ Use async pipe whenever possible for template subscriptions

Medium Priority (Important)

    ✅ Clean up service references in singleton services

    ✅ Avoid circular references between components

    ✅ Use WeakMap/WeakSet for temporary caching

    ✅ Implement proper error handling in subscriptions

Low Priority (Good Practice)

    ✅ Profile memory usage regularly in development

    ✅ Write unit tests for subscription cleanup

    ✅ Use ESLint rules to catch potential leaks

    ✅ Monitor production apps for memory growth



8. Bundle Optimization Checklist ✅


    Critical Optimizations (High Impact)
        ✅ Enable production build with ng build --configuration=production

        ✅ Implement lazy loading for feature modules

        ✅ Use tree-shakable imports (lodash-es, date-fns vs moment)

        ✅ Optimize RxJS imports - import operators individually

        ✅ Enable AOT compilation (enabled by default in production)

    Important Optimizations (Medium Impact)

        ✅ Analyze bundle size with webpack-bundle-analyzer

        ✅ Set bundle budgets in angular.json

        ✅ Optimize Angular Material imports - import specific modules

        ✅ Use OnPush change detection to reduce bundle execution time

        ✅ Implement service workers for caching

    Fine-tuning (Low-Medium Impact)

        ✅ Optimize images with lazy loading and responsive images

        ✅ Use dynamic imports for heavy libraries

        ✅ Remove unused dependencies from package.json

        ✅ Optimize fonts with font-display: swap

        ✅ Implement preloading strategies for critical routes`
