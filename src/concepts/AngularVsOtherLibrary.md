1 · Angular vs AngularJS (the legacy upgrade)
──────────────────────────────────
Angular replaces AngularJS’s digest-cycle MVC engine with a modern, component-based design driven by TypeScript and the Ivy AOT compiler. That change gives three practical wins.

Early error catching: templates are type-checked at build time, so a misspelled property fails the build instead of crashing in production.

Faster startup and smaller bundles: Ivy pre-compiles templates into tiny ɵɵ opcodes and tree-shakes unused code, whereas AngularJS ships raw HTML strings that the browser must parse on every load.

Predictable performance: change detection is a single array walk instead of digest cycles with thousands of watchers, so large grids scroll smoothly without special hacks.

2 · Angular vs React (framework vs library)
──────────────────────────────────
React deliberately focuses on the view layer; you assemble routing, state, forms and testing from third-party packages. Angular ships all of that—router with lazy loading, reactive forms, HttpClient, i18n, unit-test utilities—under one, version-locked umbrella. That “batteries-included” philosophy matters when multiple teams must share conventions.
TypeScript is first-class in Angular, so dependency-injection tokens, generics and decorators are part of the official API, giving compile-time safety for cross-team contracts. In React you rely on voluntary TS typings or PropTypes, and DI is ad-hoc through context or external libraries.
Finally, Angular’s Ivy renderer can drop change-detection entirely for parts of the tree when you switch a component to OnPush or signals, whereas React’s reconciliation still walks the virtual DOM diff for every render, even if it’s fast.

3 · Angular vs Vue (enterprise rails vs progressive core)
──────────────────────────────────
Vue’s appeal is its light weight and gentle learning curve; you can scaffold a prototype with a single CDN script. Angular, by contrast, demands you learn modules, CLI, RxJS, and decorators—but repays that effort with enterprise-grade structure: hierarchical DI, role-based router guards, zone/hydration strategies, and strict update cadence backed by Google’s LTS policy.
Vue’s reactivity system excels in small to mid-size apps where bundle size is king; Angular emphasises long-term maintainability and tooling—CLI schematics, differential loading, strict mode, standalone APIs—that reduce human error in 100-k-line monorepos.

4 · Low-level edge nobody else matches
──────────────────────────────────
Because Ivy compiles each component in isolation (the “locality principle”), a change in BillingWidget never rebuilds ReportsModule; this shrinks incremental builds and enables per-component lazy import—something neither React nor Vue offer out of the box.
